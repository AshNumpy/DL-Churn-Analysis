### Predicting the Customers Churn with Artificial Neural Networks  
  
In this project we will learn how to create a artifical neural networks and how to predict customers churn.  
  
Churn analytics is the process of measuring the rate at which customers quit the product, site, or service.  
It answers the questions “Are we losing customers?”

Trying to acquire new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing customers.  
Thats why we try to retaining existing customers.
  
#### Requirements  
  
<img src='https://keras.io/img/logo.png' width='700' height='200'>  
  
We will use [Keras][keras] for neural network so the requirements:  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
  
#### Installation  
  
- TensorFlow:  
If you want to install latest TensorFlow be sure your python version is must be equal or greater 3.7  

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
  
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
  
- Keras:  

```bash
pip install keras
```
  
- Scikit-learn:
  
```bash
pip install scikitlearn
```
  
- Pandas:  
```bash
pip install pandas
```
  
- Numpy:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

#### Datasets  
You can find the churn datas on `../Datasets/Churn_Modelling.csv`. Also there is some train and test datas.
